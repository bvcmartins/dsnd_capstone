    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This post discuss in detail the project \"Create a Customer Segmentation Report for Arvato Financial Services\", which is one of the Data Scientist's nanodegree capstone options. It is in fact a continuation of a previous project whose solution was posted [here](https://github.com/bvcmartins/dsndProject3). I chose it because of its broad scope which involves a reasonably complex data cleaning procedure, unsupervised learning, analysis of imbalanced data, and prediction using supervised learning tools. In the following I will discuss my solution for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Arvato kindly provided us the following four datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Azdias: general elements of the german population (891221 entries, 366 features)\n",
    "2. Customers: same features but containing only customers (191652 entries, 369 features)\n",
    "3. Mailout_train: training set containing potential customers chosen to receive mail ads. It also contains information if the ad was responded \n",
    "4. Mailout_test: testing set for the supervised learning model\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of that two other files were provided:\n",
    "1. DIAS Attributes - Values 2017: information about code levels of each attribute\n",
    "2. DIAS Information Levels - Attributes 2017: high-level information about each attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the features are ordinal and the numbers only represent a label for ranked value levels. Columns marked as float are actually comprised by ints but were only marked that way because they contain NaN, which is itself a float. The latest pandas version allows us to use the type Int64 which supports a integer NaN. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also 6 features of type object. These are categorical variables, except for EINGEFUEGT_AM, which is datetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the features contained NaNs. Actually, NaNs comprised almost 10% of all data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning this dataset was a relatively complex task. The steps are outlined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* pre-cleaning\n",
    "* converting missing values to NaN\n",
    "* assessing missing data per feature\n",
    "* assessing missing data per row\n",
    "* converting mixed-type features to ordinal or binary features\n",
    "* one-hot encoding categorical features\n",
    "* standard scaling numerical features\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pre-cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "We defined a function to perform general-purpose operations like converting all numeric features to Int64 (support to integer NaN) and make substitutions for some non-standard missing data encodings."
